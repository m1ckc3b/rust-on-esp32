# Rust on ESP32

I purchased a basic ESP32 starter kit created by Lafvin with the plan to build each of the 12 projects with Rust instead of Arduino as the documentation calls for.

Bare-programing with Arduino is easier than Rust because of the abstraction layers offers by the sdk but Rust gives us more power to handle the bare-metal with high-level programing style.

Here is details about each project:

[Project_0](./project_0/):
[Project_1](./project_1/):
[Project_2](./project_2/):
